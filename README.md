## ❖・Introduction・❖

This assignment extends on your first assignment by applying basic principles of design using CSS.

---

## ❖・Preflight・❖

1. You’ll need to install _editorconfig_, _Stylelint_, and _HTMLHint_ for this project, and Node is required to do so. Download and [install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. With Node installed, launch your command line interface, or CLI, and install _Stylelint_: `sudo npm i -g stylelint`
3. Install _editorconfig_: `sudo npm i -g editorconfig`
4. Install _HTMLHint_: `sudo npm i -g htmlhint`
5. And, finally, make sure you address the feedback from the first assignment *before* beginning this assignment.

## ❖・Directions・❖

* You may **not** use any third-party libraries for this project. **All the code you include _must_ be your own.**
* Create a style sheet called `style.css` and place it in the included `css` folder. If you use CSS variables, place them in `variables.css`, which also goes in the `css` folder. **No embedded or inline CSS is allowed.**
* Style the site-wide navigation of your assignment as a row of links, **not** a column.
* Employ two colors — neither of which can be a neutral — for backgrounds, text, or accents, such as borders, bullets, etc. See [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) for ideas, and take special note of its [Accessibility Tools](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer).
* Reassign the default image you used in assignment 1 from `index.html` to `about.html`.
* Add a Creative Commons-licensed image as a hero to the `index.html` page.
* Any images you use must be placed in the enclosed `img` folder and **cannot be larger than 1MB**.
* Employ two different typefaces from Google Fonts into your assignment: one for headings and one for reading text.
* Your HTML must be valid.
* Your CSS must also be valid.
* Folders and files must use lowercase, combined with kebab case. For example, `do-this` or `do-this.html`. Further, no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); no camel case (`notThis`); and, no snake case (`not_this`).
